# Resident Evil Complete Lore

## Birth and Rise of Umbrella

In the 19th century, a man named [Henry Travis](), through many years of exploring Africa wrote a book detailing plants, animals and, the culture of the people of Africa. He was the first who mentioned a rare flower native to West Africa known as Stairway of the Sun.

What was so special about the rare flower is that it was not only toxic to most who consumed which were caused by a virus infection but under special circumstances, those who survive the infection gained superhuman strength and intelligence.

[Travis]() due to his book failure, died from a deep depression.

In the 1960s, three virologists, [Oswell E. Spencer](), [Edward Ashford]() and [James Marcus]() upon learning about the virus through Travis's works, they rediscovered the flowers in West Africa in an ancient stone garden protect by an ancient African tribe known as Ndipaya.

The tribe ritualistically eat the flowers and whoever resisted the effects upon its consumption was declared the strongest man and was appointed chief.

[Spencer](), [Ashford]() and [Marcus]() knowning each other since college, shared the ideals of using the virus to create a new generation of educated superhumans that would pioneer a new age.

[Marcus]() made preparations to leave Africa with a sample to begin his research immediately. The virus was named Progenitor.

[Marcus]() concluded that the mass-cultivated flowers were not able to produce the virus due to the local environmental factors necessary upon cultivation.

[Spencer]() was a cold, and ambitious individual who had the vision to remake the world creating a superior race of humans and make himself as his ruler.

As a means of funding [Marcus]() research in its entirety, [Spencer](characters/oswell-spencer.md) began making plans to set up a pharmaceutical company in March 1967 to raise the necessary funds. They named the company Umbrella and would be making profits from selling bio-weapons for military applications.

During this time, [Spencer]() began construction on a mansion in the Arklay Mountains the would also serve as a secret Umbrella laboratory. [George Trevor]() was the architect responsible for the design and the construction of the mansion. [Spencer]() admired  his surreal designs.

Upon the completion of the mansion in 1967, [Spencer]() realised that [Trevor]() was aware of the laboratory and knew too much and began making plans for disposing him. He invited [Trevor](), his wife [Jessica]() and his 14 years old daughter [Lisa]() to the house to celebrate the completion of the Spencer Mansion. [Spencer]() planned to use them as test subjects in his Progenitor research.
