## Natural History

In the 19th century, a european explorer named Henry Travis, through many years of exploring Africa, dedicated 35 years of his life analysing and cataloging fauna, flora and, the culture of the people of Africa.

In his book, Survey of Natural History, he talked about a expedition that occurred in West Africa, in the Kijuju region where he found a rare flower known as the Stairway of the Sun also known by his the scientific name Sonnentreppe.

The flower was found in the ruins of an extinct Kingdom Ndipaya in a underground garden called Sun Garden.



What was so special about the rare flower is that it was not only toxic to most who consumed which were caused by a virus infection but under special circumstances, those who survive the infection gained
superhuman strength and intelligence.

The historical value and economic of Survey of Natural History was contested by the scientific community which led to  Henry and his book being seen as fraud. Due to his book failure, Henry died from a deep depression.

## Dark Ambitions

In the 1960s, three virologists and longtime friends, [Ozwell E. Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md), [Edward Ashford](characters/edward-ashford.md) and [James Marcus](characters/james-marcus.md) upon learning about the virus through Travis's works, they rediscovered the flowers in West Africa in an ancient stone garden protect by an ancient African tribe known as Ndipaya.

Edward comes from the noble Ashford Familty. Professor Marcus is, perhaps, the most brilliant of the three. Spencer is the wealthiest.

The tribe ritualistically eat the flowers and whoever resisted the effects upon its consumption was declared the strongest man and was appointed chief.

[Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md), [Ashford](characters/edward-ashford.md) and [Marcus](characters/james-marcus.md) knowning each other since college, shared the ideals of using the virus to create a new generation of educated superhumans that would pioneer a new age.

[Marcus](characters/james-marcus.md) and his student Brandon Bailey made preparations to leave Africa with a sample to begin research immediately. The virus was named Progenitor. They concluded that the mass-cultivated flowers were not able to produce the virus due to the local environmental factors necessary upon cultivation.

Bailey returns to Africa where he can send remittances of the Progenitor to [Marcus](characters/james-marcus.md).

Upon realizing the value of the flowers, [Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) used his influence to control the region of extration of the plant and got rid of the descendents of the Ndipaya tribe.

It's in this period that the divergence of objectives and ideals between the old friends began to appear. [Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) and [Edward](characters/edward-ashford.md) were very ambitious and wanted power and wealth as results of their discoveries. [Marcus](characters/james-marcus.md) was obsessed with science and only care about studying the virus.

[Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) had plans of his own where he had the vision to remake the world creating a superior race of humans and make himself as his ruler.


## Patient Zero

During this time, [Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) began construction on a mansion in the Arklay Mountains the would also serve as a secret Umbrella laboratory. [George Trevor](characters/george-trevor.md) was the architect responsible for the design and the construction of the mansion. [Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) admired his surreal designs.

Upon the completion of the mansion in 1967, [Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) realised that [Trevor](characters/george-trevor.md) was aware of the laboratory and knew too much and began making plans for disposing him. He invited [Trevor](characters/george-trevor.md), his wife [Jessica](characters/jessica-trevor.md) and his 14 years old daughter [Lisa](characters/lisa-trevor.md) to the house to celebrate the completion of the Spencer Mansion. [Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) planned to use them as test subjects in his Progenitor research.

[Trevor](characters/george-trevor.md) was busy with work at the time and sends his wife and daughter, [Jessica](characters/jessica-trevor.md) and [Lisa](characters/lisa-trevor.md) to travel first to the Spencer Mansion. Unfortunally upon arrivel, Jessica and Lisa are imprisoned in the secret laboratory built under the mansion.

When [Trevor](characters/george-trevor.md) finally arrived at the Spencer Mansion, he didn't find his family. [Spencer](characters/ozwell-spencer.md) had told him the they have left due to an news regarding a sick aunt.

[Trevor](characters/george-trevor.md) is also imprisoned but manages to escape his confinement and runs into the underground tunnels. With no chance of escaping, he stumbles upon a tombstone with his name written on it. Being desperate, exhausted and starving for days, [Trevor](characters/george-trevor.md) dies alone in the tunnels.

[Jessica](characters/jessica-trevor.md) and [Lisa](characters/lisa-trevor.md) suffer as subjects. Spencer's scientists creats two derivations of the Progenitor Virus. [Jessica](characters/jessica-trevor.md) receives sample Type-A, which causes a terrible reaction and results in her death. [Lisa](characters/lisa-trevor.md) receive sample Type-B e her body reacts , adapting to the virus. The girl is kept isoladed and under surveillance.

[Lisa](characters/lisa-trevor.md) received a new dose of the Progenitor and as side-effect, the girl began to lose her sanity and suffer severes physical deformaties. She also gained an uncommon physical strength and accelerated regenerative capabilities.
